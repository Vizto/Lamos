3. System Requirements
 - Web server with HTTP Basic authentication support (e.g. Apache)
 - PHP 5.2 (or higher)
 - MySQL 5.03 (or higher)


4. Installation

At present there is no installation tool. Therefore this is yet a manual 
task and requires good knowledge of the target system.

Basic steps:
 - Extract the contents of lamos.tar.gz into a directory on the web server
 - Password-protect the installation directory (eg. with HTTP basic 
   authentication via .htaccess)
   Note: Everybody who should access the lamos web pages must have access 
         to the directory with a username and password. 
         Additionally each username must be inserted as "name" in the 
         database table lms_user.
 - Setup the database tables using the SQL statements in the 
   subdirectory "installation"
   Note: If other table names will be used, the SQL statements must be 
         adjusted
 - Edit the the configuration file config/lms_config.inc.php to include
   your project title, url and database access settings
Optional:
 - Move the configuration file "config/lms_config.inc.php" to 
   a secure location (outside the web-accessible area)
 - Adjust index.php, count.php, lledit.php and linklist.inc.php to the 
   new location of the configuration file: Update the folowing line 
   near the top of the file:
       require_once("config/lms_config.inc.php");
